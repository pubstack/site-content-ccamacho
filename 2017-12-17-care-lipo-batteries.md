For a while now, there are many videos and websites that are talking about how
to safely use a LiPo battery. The reason for this concern was the multiple
explosions of Samsung manufactured mobile phones, news that toured the entire
world and hit strongly the famed technology company. 

In fact, those explosions had nothing to do with the phones as such, but with
the battery they used. Yes, exactly, we are talking about the famed lithium ion
polymer batteries, better known as LiPo, which promise to deliver a major 
quantity of energy for a longer period of time.But this efficiency has a cost 
and is that if the battery does not charge and discharge in an adequate manner
or is not stored safely; can get swollen, last for just a minute or, in the
worst of cases, even overheat and burst into flames. Obviously this does not 
always happen, usually before exploding, the battery generates a series of
warnings, such as a smell of molten plastic due to the rise in temperature, 
smoke or more subtly bulges, as it happens to any other conventional battery 
with the pass of time.  

### Why are LiPo batteries so fragile?

The reason for the fragility of these batteries lies in their power and size.
That is, most standard batteries such as NiCd or NiHm, contain 1.2 volt cells,
so they are very heavy and large batteries when you need more power. On the
other hand, the cells of LiPo batteries are 3.7 volts, meaning that even with 
the same number of cells, an optimum level of power can be reached.

The reduction of cells is what allows having smaller and lighter batteries,
which is greatly appreciated in the world of drone racing, but also amounts to
an increased risk because the volatile electrolyte used exclusively in the LiPo,
can get out of control or overheat and explode destroying not only the battery 
but also several components of your multicopter.

But before panicking, you need to know that there is a series of good practices
that will help you avoid collateral damage and even extend the life of your
battery, and none is crazy or impossible enough not to carry it out.

#### Good practices to charge your LiPo battery.

As we said, one of the factors that can have negative consequences in the life
of your LiPo; or worse, generate large explosive disasters, is the process you
follow to recharge your battery. Here we quote some of the safety tips that the
experts have provided for the moment of charging our LiPo type battery.

        <p class="text-white">
<strong>Always use an intelligent charger:</strong> At the time of charging your
battery, since conventional chargers continue to feed energy into the battery 
even though it is already charged, and this extra energy can cause overheating
of it until it burst.  
</p>

        <p class="text-white">
<strong>Do not charge your battery if it is still connected to your drone:</strong> 
A LiPo battery cannot be treated like the batteries of conventional cell phones
that were the lesson that left us all the chaos of the Samsung Galaxy. Therefore
at the time of recharging, please disconnect them from your race vehicle and 
put them to charge in a safe place, away from liquids or flammable elements and
with a lot of ventilation.
</p>
</div>

<strong>Let your battery rest before charging:</strong> If you have just 
participated in a race or flight training, it is advisable to wait at least 15
minutes before putting your battery to charge, especially if it is still hot due
to the use. 

#### Good practices in regards to safety.

In this section we explain how to proceed under exceptional circumstances and
what other implements you can use to avoid accidents with your LiPo batteries.

        <p class="text-white">
<strong>Do not lose sight of your battery when it is charging:</strong> 
Most of the times the LiPo tend to fail just during the charging process, so it
is advisable never to trust and stay close by any inconvenience. So in case they
get damaged, overheat or start smelling, you can disconnect it immediately to
take it to a remote and safe area where you make sure it does not explode or, 
if it does, causes no harm but to itself.

        <p class="text-white">
<strong>Buy fireproof or flameproof bags:</strong> Although they are not a
mandatory accessory, buying this type of bags greatly reduces the risks when 
charging, storing or moving your LiPo batteries, since in case of explosion or 
fire, everything will be restricted to the inside of the bag and the rest of 
your belongings will not suffer any damage.
</p>
</div>

<strong>Install smoke detectors in recharge zones:</strong> It is not necessary
to buy the most expensive detectors, only one that is efficient enough and 
sensitive to the presence of smoke, so you can react on time and avoid any bad
experience.

And there you have our tips for the responsible use of LiPo batteries, in 
future posts we will be talking about how to store your batteries safely and
dedicate an entire entry to fireproof bags, so you can choose the most suitable
for you.
