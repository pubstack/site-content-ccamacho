On August 1, drone manufacturer DJI presented
a real drone arena. In the DJI Arena, drone
pilots can gain experience with drone flying
and have a beautiful trail.


#### Fly

<div class="nk-post-text mt-0">
    <img style="height: 155px;" class="pull-right mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/dji-arena-02.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-white">
Dronepilots can use the arena for no more than 14
dollars for 3 hours. To avoid collisions, up to 12
pilots can fly at the same time in the arena.
        </p>
</div>


#### Arena

<div class="nk-post-text mt-0">
    <img style="height: 155px;" class="pull-left mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/dji-arena-03.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-white">
The DJI Arena is indoor so that you can always fly.
One does not have to take into account the rules for
drones. Next to the arena there is also a workshop
where the pilots can perform small maintenance on their drone.
        </p>
</div>


#### Spectators

<div class="nk-post-text mt-0">
    <img style="height: 155px;" class="pull-right mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/dji-arena-04.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-white">
The DJI Arena is also accessible to spectators.
A special space has been created where spectators
watch live on LCD TVs with the drones camera. In
addition, there is also a place where people can
learn more about drone technology.
        </p>
</div>



#### FPV Racing

<div class="nk-post-text mt-0">
    <img style="height: 155px;" class="pull-left mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/dji-arena-05.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-white">
The track is equipped with various LED illuminated
gates and special starting blocks. Despite the fact
that the DJI drones are mainly made for aerial
photography, the drone manufacturer now seems to
focus on FPV racing. It is therefore obvious that
the drone manufacturer may soon be presenting a FPV race.
