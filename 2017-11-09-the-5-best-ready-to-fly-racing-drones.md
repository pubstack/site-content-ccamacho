One of the great wonders of the drone racing world
is the satisfaction that anyone can build
his own custom drone. But if you are an
impatient pilot you can go straight to the
action that is getting a RTF drone.

Today's article is dedicated to those who simply
like to experience the adrenaline of flying, but
do not like at all the idea of having to build
their own drone from scratch.

#### Top 5 RTF (ready-to-fly) racing drones.

It is important to point out each one of these
racing drones as they fulfill the following basic
requirements, durability, velocity, maneuverability
and a simple design to facilitate the
installation of spare parts either for
repairs or improvement.

1. **Walkera Runner 250:** One of the classics in
the drone racing world, it was one of the first
ready-to-fly models in the market
and even today is among the best performers with
one of the best quality/price ratios.

        <p class="text-white">
    This is one of the
    drones that comes with everything included,
    a carbon fiber chassis,
    engines, propellers, a Devo 7 transmitter, a 800 TVL camera,
    and a 25C lipo 3S battery. The Walkera Runner
    250 has a signal range of 1 kilometer and is capable
    of reaching a velocity of 40 Km/hr.

2. **Nighthawk Pro 280:** An excellent choice for a ready
to fly racing drone because is one of the few drones that
can guarantee optimum agility thanks
to its carbon fiber chassis and its powerful 1300 KV
engines that provides a great reaction capacity.

        <img style="width: 300px;" class="pull-right mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/best-rtf-02-nighthawk-pro-280.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-white">
    It also
    includes a Skyline 32 controller and has a complete FPV
    system with a 700 TVL camera, so the
    only thing you must buy separately are the goggles,
    batteries and the transmitter.
        </p>
    </div>


3. **Immersion RC Vortex 250 PRO:** The ideal model to
stop being a newbie in the racing world.
It counts with a carbon fiber
chassis, arms, controller and other
components; it also includes a black box that
registers telemetry data and a support base to 
install a GoPro camera or any other 
action camera available in the market.

        <p class="text-white">
    It is more
    expensive previous models but definitely worth it.
    The only thing you're gonna have to buy separately is a
    battery pack up to 4S and the transmitter/receiver of the radio
    the signal. 
        </p>
    </div>
4. **Falcon 250 FPV:** This drone fits into the good
and cheap category, is the most inexpensive model
in our list, but paradoxically turns out to be
one of the most complete and powerful drones.
