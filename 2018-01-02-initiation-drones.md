If you are new to drone racing, you may be wondering
if this is for you. Well, in reality the only way to
know if this could be a hobby that you would find amusing or if it could
catch your interest to the point that you would seriously dedicate to
become a drone pilot, is to get yourself behind a radio control
and put on the FPV goggles.
 
In fact, a very important part of this experience is provided by the
equipment that we use, none the less, it is common to avoid making a
large investment at the beginning because we don't know if this
is a simple curiosity, if it will be a passing hobby or
if on the contrary, it will become the passion to which we will
dedicate our free time, so forth it's not advisable to purchase
equipment that after all, we don't know how to use it in this experimental
phase.
That's why you can find in the market something called
initiation drones, so that people who are just beginning to familiarize
with this experience could do it without expending a lot of money.

#### What are initiation drones?

Initiation drones are inexpensive multicopters that possess a
thicker and more durable chassis in comparison than those
used in racing drones, their components and spare parts
are simpler to replace and easy to find. 

The main purpose of these initiation models is to withstand all
the mistreatment delivered by an inexperienced pilot. In general,
when learning to pilot drones, it is fairly common to perform
emergency landings, to crash our drone against any obstacle
or simply lose control and crash it to the ground.

#### Better initiation drones for non-pilots 

It is important to know that there are several initiation drone models
and that each one of them will present a certain degree of
difficulty for the novel pilot. Though the most recommended models
for beginners are those with a high flight stability,
resistance to impacts and low price. So when it comes to
drones that fulfill these three criteria, we recommend the
following models:

        <p class="text-white">
<strong>Syma X5C:</strong> This is the initiation drone by excellence, so much so
that is the best selling model on Amazon. It has a 2
megapixel HD camera attached to it that renders fairly good images,
besides its flight stability is enviable and is strong enough to
survive the most common accidents for a pilot
with few flight hours.

    <img style="height: 155px;" class="pull-right mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/syma_02.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-white">
<strong>Syma X5HC:</strong> A model with more advanced features than the previous
one, for instance, it has an altitude leveling system that allows
us to keep our drone steady at a constant hight from the floor
without the need to maintain pressure over the joystick lever.

<div class="nk-post-text mt-0">
    <img style="height: 155px;" class="pull-left mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/syma_03.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-white">
<strong>Syma X5UC:</strong> Last but not least, we have a model for those who want to
live the experience of flying a drone in failsafe mode, since this
little friend not only offers the same features of the last 2 but
also has an automatic landing and take off system, so won't have
any accident due to a forced landing.

Don't wait any longer and start training to become an expert drone racing pilot!
