Ever wanted a cool looking 3d printed race drone?.
With this DIY tutorial you can build your own fully equipped racing
quad with folding arms and excellent flying characteristics.
You can get all the necessary STL files from
[thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:958541).
I hope you enjoy it as much as I build and fly.

#### Step 1: A WHOLE PILE OF SCREWS

<div class="nk-post-text mt-0">
    <img style="height: 155px;" class="pull-right mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/firefly-02.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-white">
For the construction you need a whole set of screws.
Look at the picture for all the details. You also need
damper balls for the camera plate. You can get them in
many different colors and strengths. Choose these
depending on the weight of your camera.
        </p>
</div>


#### Step 2: MAIN FRAME

<div class="nk-post-text mt-0">
    <img style="height: 155px;" class="pull-left mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/firefly-03.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-white">
For the main frame you have to print the parts below.
Print the main frame with 25% fill. The sides
and bumpers are best printed with 50% fill.
However, the bumper will be heavily invaded in a crash,
so you better print a few spare parts.
        </p>
</div>

#### Step 3: Start the build

<div class="nk-post-text mt-0">
    <img style="height: 155px;" class="pull-right mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/firefly-04.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-white">
Use 4x M3x10MM to secure the bumper together with the bottom plate.
The next step is to fix both sides with 4x M2x10MM screws each.
        </p>
</div>

#### Step 4: The arms

<div class="nk-post-text mt-0">
    <img style="height: 155px;" class="pull-left mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/firefly-05.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-white">
The next point on our list is the poor. You must print all parts to start.
And you also need at least a 400mm long carbon fiber tube with an outer diameter of 12mm.
        </p>
</div>


#### Step 5: Cutting the carbon fiber

<div class="nk-post-text mt-0">
    <img style="height: 155px;" class="pull-right mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/firefly-06.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-white">
To make sure the motor mount and the arm itself sits cuddly
in place are not jiggling arround or twisting we need to drill
a few holes in the carbon fiber arm.
        </p>
</div>

<div class="nk-post-text mt-0">
    <img style="height: 155px;" class="pull-left mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/firefly-07.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-white">
Therefore, we cut the carbon
fiber tube to a length of 100mm. You can scratch the carbon fiber
tube at 100mm and then place it in the jig. Start gently with a
fine metal saw blade while slowly turning the carbon fiber tube.
        </p>
</div>

#### Step 6: Use the drill bit holder

<div class="nk-post-text mt-0">
    <img style="height: 155px;" class="pull-right mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/firefly-08.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-white">
I have a drill because the hole alignment is really important
with tubular arms. If the holes are in the middle, your firefly
has jaw problems. To prevent this from happening, make sure that
you ligate the devices perfectly flat on their side also making
sure that they are pressed really hard on the carbon fiber tubes.
If necessary, use a hammer.
        </p>
</div>
Now drill two 4mm holes and a 3mm hole. Turn the arm over and
drill another 3mm hole. Metal drills worked the best for me.
If you take the devices to twist them while pulling.

#### Step 7: Arm Buildup

<div class="nk-post-text mt-0">
    <img style="height: 155px;" class="pull-left mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/firefly-09.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-white">
Now that you have prepared the carbon fiber tubes,
its time for assembly. Clean the engine mountings and the hinge very well.
        </p>
</div>

<div class="nk-post-text mt-0">
    <img style="height: 155px;" class="pull-right mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/firefly-10.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-white">
First you have to secure the motors on the engine mounts.
The motor mounts are designed to accept motors with M2 screws.
To fix the motors, take the motor, 1x motor mount and 1x motor
mounting plate together and saw 2x M2x8MM. Make sure that the
motor cables are facing the right side.
        </p>
</div>

#### Step 8:

<div class="nk-post-text mt-0">
    <img style="height: 155px;" class="pull-left mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/firefly-11.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-white">
The next step is to add the motor body floor.
Press the motor mount with the motor onto the
carbon fiber tube. The guide holes show the exact position.
        </p>
</div>
Now attach the lower part of the motor mount with 4x M2x10MM screws.
Screw it a little at a time and go slowly. You do not want to break
it before your first flight. Now you can add the motor stands.
You do not have to screw them in just press them in. Align the
arm hinge with the 3mm holes on the other end of the arm.


#### Step 9: Clip Lock

<div class="nk-post-text mt-0">
    <img style="height: 155px;" class="pull-right mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/firefly-12.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-white">
To finish the arm mechanism, use the 4x M3x10MM in the bumper
to screw in 4 clip locks at the front. Use another 4x M3x10MM
in the back to do the same thing.
        </p>
</div>

#### Step 10:

<div class="nk-post-text mt-0">
    <img style="height: 155px;" class="pull-left mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/firefly-13.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-white">
Now just put the arms in place and make sure that
the hole for the joint is aligned with the
corresponding hole on the bottom plate.
        </p>
</div>

<div class="nk-post-text mt-0">
    <img style="height: 155px;" class="pull-right mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/firefly-14.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-white">
        </p>
</div>

#### Step 11: Secure the arms

To attach the arms, take 4x M3x32MM screws
and start screwing them into the bottom plate.
As soon as you reach the top plate. Take the M3
washers before screwing on the 4x M3
self-locking nuts.
<div class="row vertical-gap">
<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4">
    <img style="height: 155px;" class="pull-left mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/firefly-15.jpg" alt="">
</div>
<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4">
    <img style="height: 155px;" class="pull-right mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/firefly-16.jpg" alt="">
</div>
<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4">
    <img style="height: 155px;" class="pull-left mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/firefly-17.jpg" alt="">
</div>
</div>
#### Step 12: FINISH IT

<div class="nk-post-text mt-0">
    <img style="height: 155px;" class="pull-right mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/firefly-18.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-white">
Now simply push the bumper balls into the holes provided and install the camera plate.
You are done. I hope you have a lot of fun with this little quad.
Print out some spare clamps, bumpers and motor stands, and you should be well-prepared for the field.
        </p>
