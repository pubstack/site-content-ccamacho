Last year the New York Company Autonomous decided to revolutionize
the world of drone racing by offering a complete and inexpensive
initiation kit.
We are talking about the 'Drone Racing Game', a package with all
you need to set your own race circuit with the ability to play
online against other players who have purchased the kit. 

### What does the Drone Racing Game kit contain? 

There are available two pack on the market, the Pro Version which
includes 2 race drones (black and white) with the following
specifications:

*  HD camera.
*  WiFi connection.
*  Controllers with FPV support.
* Mobile application.

In addition to all of this, both drones have a flight autonomy
of about 6 - 7 minutes, a range that exceeds the 100 meters, a
30 cm frame, a 500 mAh battery and a total recording time of 30
minutes. And the best of all is its total price of 99 USD.

The second package is the Ultimate Version; it comes with
FPV goggles, nine flags that serve as obstacles and 50 cones.
The price difference is only 50 more dollars but it is
worth paying this difference.

### How the concept of the Drone Racing Game was born?

As we said at the beginning of this article, the idea of the
'Drone Racing Game' starter's package emerged in the middle of last
year. Actually, it was a crowdfunding project launched by the Indiegogo
web platform. The goal of the developers of Autonomous was to reach the
sum of 10.000 USD but when they found themselves surpassing the amount in
less than one month, they decided to raise the stakes and try to collect
80.000 USD to include an extra battery.

Nowadays, it is already available in the market, also, they
created a big competition for this brand, meaning that
Autonomous has exceeded all its expectations and has
catapulted themselves as one of the largest businesses in the world of race drones.
