Just a few days ago these FPV goggles came on the
market and they are giving a lot to talk about, especially
because it is a piece of equipment with some specifications
that can leave anyone breathless.

We are talking about FPV goggles with a resolution of 1280x720
with the receiver and an HDMI connection. Not to mention its
42ยบ FOV which is equivalent to that of an 80" TV, that is,
an accessory that will take anyone to fully immerse in the
multicopter cockpit. 

###Content of the FPV TopSky F7X goggles package

The TopSky company, responsible for the development, sale, and distribution
of the goggles has decided to provide race drone lovers with a high-quality
product. Just by opening the package is enough to feel satisfied with the purchase. 

The goggles come inside of a plastic case with a padded pouch which brings
the necessary protection to transport them with total comfort and without
fear of scratching them along the way. In addition, the 
company has included a 2200mAh Li-Po battery without balancing 
cable.

Other accessories that come with the kit are:
  * A receiver and its antenna (RP-SMA).
  * Charger.
  * A red strap to keep our goggles attached to our head.
  * A MicroHDMI-MiniHDMI cable.
  * A foam faceplate with Velcro.
  * A cable to connect the goggles to external receivers.
  * A suede cloth.

### Quality analysis of the FPV TopSky F7X glasses.

Like all new products that come out to compete in the market,
these FPV goggles have their pros and cons.

In one hand we have the faceplate or goggles display, which is
very comfortable but maybe some people feel that it is difficult
for them to breathe when they wear it. On the other hand, this
display is made out of plastic and not foam, which causes
discomfort in the face after a while.

The company has thought that this inconvenience can be solved
with an extra faceplate made out of foam, which we must adhere
to our goggles, but this instead of making the experience more
pleasant ends up making it much more uncomfortable.

As for the image quality, we can say without fear of being wrong that
the TopSky F7X are among the best FPV goggles delivering the best image
resolution on the market. However, the only criticism we make and for
which we could not find a solution, is that PCs do not recognize them,
and that is why it has not been possible to verify the quality on the screen.

        <p class="text-white">
Conclusion: The TopSky F7X goggles are the ideal accessory if you
are just getting started in the FPV world because they offer you
many advantages and components at a very low price. None the less,
if you already have experience with FPV systems, then the logical
path you should take is to buy some FatShark goggles, which still
are the best FPV products in the market.
