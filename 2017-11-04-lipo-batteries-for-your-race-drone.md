When starting in the drone races world, it's
common to feel clueless about the best components
to create your own drone, one that beats all the other competitors
in velocity, lightweight, stability, and efficiency. Obviously,
among all the necessary elements to make a functional drone,
one of the most important is
the battery, providing power to all components and keeping it running
as long as the match goes on.

Like other electronic devices that need batteries
to work, the world of RC devices
has gone through a quite interesting development process, not
just because they have increased its power storage capacity,
but also because they have become so much smaller and powerful
when compared to its predecessors. 

## Evolution of LiPo batteries for your drone.

Even before the drones age, the world of radio
controlled vehicles competitions already existed,
but the level of complexity of these cars, vessels,
and even aerial vehicles was much more dependent on
mechanical components, nowadays drones depend more
on technology research and development. 
This allows improving drones
performance levels, by adding sensors, transmitters o
telemetry components. This increased
the energy demand of this little but sophisticated
flying objects, pushing companies to design ever
lighter, longer lasting and more efficient batteries,
so drones can fly faster and for a longer period
of time.
In the beginning, the only available batteries for
drones were NiMh and NiCd, which
fulfilled their purpose but were heavy and
sometimes worked below the engines maximum capacity.
Nowadays we can count
on Lithium Polymer batteries, better known as LiPo, these
batteries are lighter and provide
as much power as the user needs allowing to have more powerful
and quicker vehicles.

LiPo batteries are rechargeable but unlike cellphones
batteries (NiCd or NiMh), LiPo batteries do not suffer
from memory effect,
meaning that their charge performance
is not affected by constant
discharge cycles, neither their service lifetime or their
power storage capacity get diminished by it.
Additionally,
these batteries have been designed connecting their cells
in parallel to increase their power by summing each cell
capacity, according to the different components requirements
available in the market.

## Characteristics that you should bear in mind when buying LiPo batteries for your drone.

When purchasing a LiPo battery, you should bear in mind 3
essential characteristics that are related to the power,
duration and delivery capacity they can provide without putting in risk
any electronic component or the battery itself.
Let's review each one of this features separately.

* **Potency or cells number:** A LiPo
battery is built by a series of cells 
connected each other, this connection is based in
a parallel circuit and each
cell has a capacity of 3.7 volts (V).
The number referencing how many cells are
stacked up together is usually referenced as
an "S" in any battery model.

        <p class="text-white">
An S1 battery has only a 3.7 V cell, whereas an S3 has 3 cell of 3.7 V each, and therefore
it's real voltage is 11.1 V, in other words, 3.7 V x 3 cells. This feature is important
because most of the electronic components related to drones
indicate with a number followed by an "S" letter the required voltage
to reach optimal performance.
</p>
</div>

* **Duration of the battery or mAh:** This feature indicates the energy storage
capacity that a battery has, so the bigger this number is, the longer your
drone will fly. But generally, the batteries with great storage capacity
are bigger, heavier and much more expensive than the rest.

    <img style="height: 155px;" class="pull-left mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/LiPo-batteries.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-white">
It is advisable to drone competitors to look for one
that doesn't hold back your drone by adding weight and
to be able to hold the flight time of
a match without turning the low battery warning.
</p>
</div>

* **Discharge capacity or C rate:** This references the capacity of a battery to deliver
the energy the drone requires without sustaining any damage or stressing other
components of the drone. The nomenclature that identifies this characteristic is a
number followed by a letter "C".

    <img style="height: 155px;" class="pull-right mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/LiPo-c-rate.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-white">
A 25C means that we need to multiply 25 by the battery capacity in Amps to get the
maximum sustained load you can safely put on the battery.
For instance, a 25C 2000mAh battery will deliver up to 50 Amps
as the maximum sustained load you can safely put on the battery.
Going higher than that will result in, at best,
the degradation of the battery at a faster than normal pace.
At worst, it could burst into flames.
