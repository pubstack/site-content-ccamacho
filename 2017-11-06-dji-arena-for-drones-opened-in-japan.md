"Because it is important that our air technology continues to grow,
the DJI Arena concept is a new way of engaging not only hobbyists,
but also those who consider this technology for their work or just
for the excitement of flying," said Moon Tae-Hyun, DJI's Director
of Brand Management and Operations. "With the ability to crawl the
remote control itself and try out the technology itself, customer
satisfaction can be enhanced. When people understand how it works
or how easy it is to fly, they will discover what this technology
can do for them. and see a whole new world of possibilities."

The DJI Arena is open for individual and group bookings,
as well as corporate events and workshops. In the covered
area customers can enjoy flying drones all year long, despite
the weather outside.
