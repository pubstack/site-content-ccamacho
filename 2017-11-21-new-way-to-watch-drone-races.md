Lately, the drone world scene has gone through periods
of great uncertainty, because several countries have
imposed different laws about the drones usage without
an international consensus on the
matter and because of several inconveniences and large-scale 
accidents, from drones crashing against
houses and electric poles,
to pilots who have hurt people while flying over
densely populated areas, not to mention those who
have invaded the aerial space
of airports during the landing of commercial flights.
That is why security measures have been implemented, 
especially on drone racing scenarios to protect the
attending public, although in some cases the
spectator places are so far from the arena that
it ends up affecting the experience being difficult
to watch the maneuvers and their favorite pilots.

### First person view, a safe way to enjoy drone races. 

Most sponsors supporting drone races all over the world 
have realized that this distance between the public
and the race action, can result in a decrease of the
tickets sales since many of the public prefer to watch
the race arena by  streaming or through  channels like
ESPN because the action feels so much closer, or at
least that is what they thought until the arrival of
the new technology to enjoy drone races in a safe manner.

In most recent races the Aerial Sports League (ASL)
has proposed a new  strategy to motivate the public
to go to the race arena  and that strategy is nonother
than installing a series of FPV booths 
each one of which is connected to a specific drone.
This way the people 
can not only enjoy the race just like if they were on
the pilot's booth guiding the drone, but they can also
choose to observe everything from the perspective of
their favorite pilot and learn about the tricks and
maneuvers that they do during the race.

### Live the drone races with the EPSON Moverio BT-200.

This new way of living all drone races has motivated 
various companies to create goggles for the audience that not only renders the 
path and the flight maneuvers, but also strive to provide the user with other
advantages such as the ability to take a picture at any given moment or share
a video on their social networks, thanks to the signal that their goggles 
receive from the drone in its flight.

One of the first companies that attempted to provide this level of
experience was EPSON with its Moverio BT-200 augmented reality
goggles, which in addition to being very light, offers an
absolute immersion experience. The glasses have a battery with
a  6 hours duration, storage capacity of 8GB that can be expanded
to 32 GB by an external SD card, they have
a 1.2 GHz processor and 1 GB of RAM. Without a doubt, it is an excellent device
to feel in your own flesh all the adrenaline of a drone race.
