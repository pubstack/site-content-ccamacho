Getting in the world of drone racing is quite an
amazing experience, because of the special effects,
light shows, and obstacles.
All of them centered directly over the racetrack to
transform each event into a challenge for the pilots
and a quite entertaining experience for the audience
showing up in the arena.

None of the previous drone championships has been able to beat
the Xtreme Drone Circuit, better known as XDC. This is one of
the first competition circuits for professional drone racing,
given that it was the first to merge 2 key concepts in any
top-level sport, a metallic prize and a large group of
sponsors eager to get into this new sport.

### How the Xtreme Drone Circuit came about?

Drone racing got started around 2013 but back then
they were all amateur events filled with amateur
pilots that were looking for a challenge and showing
their pilot skills. However, it would not be until
2015 when the first big drone racing event came about
known as the XDC Racing.

It was around January of 2015 that a group of drone
pilots decided to create one of the most famous drone
racing events in the world, they chose Las Vegas as
their headquarters; more specifically an old abandoned
hotel that had all the necessary features to turn it
into a 165 yards long circuit. For this first edition,
only 50 pilots showed up to fight for a prize of 5000
dollars in cash and the sponsorship of some of the
most important brands in the world of drones.

By 2016 the XDC had reached such a degree of popularity that had
to go to other venue but still remained in Las Vegas. In that
occasion and thanks to the success of the previous event, the
number of sponsors increased drastically, including among them
companies like <strong>ImmersionRC Ltd</strong> and <strong>ReadyMadeRC</strong>,
which installed
booths with augmented reality goggles that were connected to the
drones during the race just for the amusement of attendees who
were granted a total immersion in the event. Another characteristic
that distinguished XDC was the design of the circuit which was no
longer  a straight line track but rather had other elements like
fire rings, dimmed lights, and a section  illuminated only by neon
lights to show an amazing event for everyone, both those who attended
to see the show in person and those who enjoyed it from their homes,
because it was during the 2016 XDC that streaming technology was
used for the first time to broadcast a drone race to the whole world.
The success of that communicational strategy was such that servers
shut down for more that one occasion due to the approximately 3000
viewers wanting to live the excitement of the event through the
screens of their computers.

### 2017, the year the Xtreme Drone Circuit became international.

It has been just 2 years since the first time the XDC saw the
light of the day, but it has already become a world-class event,
so much that this year it took place in 2 separate locations set
up in different countries. For Latin America, the gathering place
was Chile and for Europe, it was France,  the city of lights.
In both locations, the drone race was a great success, increasing
the number of pilots and sponsors at a global scale. We can't
wait to see what the 2018 XDC will bring us because there's very
little time left for such an important date and the expectation is raising.
