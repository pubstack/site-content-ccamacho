One of the characteristics that drone pilots like the most
is the possibility of getting immersed in the
experience of flying, and that is something they can only
achieve by using FPV (First Person View) equipments.
This equipment
comprises a set of components that allow the pilots to feel
as if they were on board of their drones. 

#### Components that make up the FPV system for drones.

FPV systems are comprised by 4 main components,
which could be described in detail as follows: 

* **Camera:**
The camera is the device that captures the track images
and video to be rendered through the
pilots screen display or googles.
Nowadays, analogical
cameras are being used as much as the digital ones.
Nevertheless, analog cameras are the most popular in
drone racing, as it
is much less prone to blinking and its signal get less
delay when rendering the video images.

    <p class="text-white">
    So, to choose the camera for your drone, you
    only must pay attention to a little detail regarding the
    number of horizontal lines or TVL of any given
    camera.
    This feature indicates how good will be the resolution
    and the image quality provided by the camera, meaning that the
    higher the number next to the acronym TVL, the better
    will be the image quality and transmission.
    </p>
    </div>

* **Video transmitter (video Tx):**
The video transmitter is the device that sends the signal
captured by the camera back to our screen display or the
pilot's goggles. This signal shouldn't be confused with the
transmitter signal that allows the pilot to control the drone.
The first is related to the transmission of
video content and
the latter allows the control of the drone, both signals
are transmitted at different frequencies and any
interference between both must be avoided at all cost.

    <p class="text-white">
    The video transmitters can work properly at different radio frequencies,
    each them provide a series of advantages and disadvantages.
    Let´s see every one of them in detail.
    </p>
    </div>
    - **900Mhz frequency:** It is the lowest frequency, therefore is the one
    with the longest range and the highest level of penetration whenever
    there are obstacles. None the less, it uses the biggest and
    heaviest antenna, so it might be illegal in certain countries.
    - **1.3 GHz frequency:** In order to use this frequency
    it is necessary to possess a license or permit similar
    of radio stations.
    - **2.4 GHz frequency:** Is the frequency most often used in R/C
    transmitters, and that's why it is advisable to use a different
    frequency for video transmission because it can cause interference
    within them.
    - **5.8 GHz frequency:** Is the highest frequency of all, that's
    why it has certain limitations like a reduced range and signal
    transmission problems in the presence of obstacles.
    But also turns out to have the smallest and
    lightest antennas, and it tends to be less prone to interfere with
    the transmitter signal, so it is the most recommended
    for FPV system.

*  **Single antenna video receiver (Vídeo Rx):**
Is the device in charge of receiving the wireless signal sent by
the video transmitter so both must work at the same frequency. In
other words, if the transmitter is working on a 5.8 GHz frequency,
the receiver must also be working at a frequency of 5.8 GHz,
because otherwise, our FPV system will not work at all.
    <div class="nk-gap-1"></div>
    <div class="nk-post-text mt-0">
    <img style="height: 155px;" class="float-left mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/fpv-equipment-03.jpg" alt="">
    <p class="text-white">
    The most important part of the video receiver is the antenna
    because it will have more or less range depending
    on its model and quality. Here are the 4 most common models that can be
    found often in the market:
    </p>
    </div>
    1. Linear omnidirectional polarization antennas. 
    2. Circular omnidirectional polarization antennas.
    3. Linear directional polarization antennas.
    4. Circular directional polarization antennas.

    The essential differences between each one of them are as follows.
    The directional antennas send their signal with more power in a given
    direction. Whereas the omnidirectional ones send their
    signal with the same power in every direction making them more
    efficient in shorter ranges.

    Each antenna comes set to a specific frequency,
    so you must be aware if they work on a 2.4 GHz or a 5.8Ghz
    frequency.

    The antennas that usually come attached to the transmitter
    generally are set to the lowest spectrum. It means that both,
    image quality and the frequency range are very poor.
    Consequently, it is fairly common that the majority of
    drone pilots replace them for others with better quality.

* **Goggles or screen displays for pilots:**
Choosing between goggles or screen displays depend on personal
tastes and preferences. Although most pilots prefer goggles
because it makes them feel more involved and focused on the
match, these also tend to be more expensive.
If you are getting started in the world of drone racing, you
can begin with a display that has no blue-screen. The
reason for this advice is that if the signal is low or the
reception is bad, it won't be lost completely and your screen
won't show a blue-screen, instead will continue to show you
the path even with some interference.

    <div class="nk-post-text mt-0">
    <img style="height: 155px;" class="float-right mt-0" src="/assets/images_articles/{{ page.gitlab_author_id }}/images/fpv-equipment-04.jpg" alt="">
    <p class="text-white">
    But if you want to live the whole drone racing experience from
    the beginning, you can invest a few more bucks in a pair of 
    fatshark goggles, which are the best of the market when it
    comes to signal and image quality. So to choose the model
    that better suits your needs, you only have to bear in
    mind 2 essential factors:
    </p>
    </div>
    1. **The field of view or FOV:** Is the horizontal area that you
    will be able to see through the goggles. In other words, the
    more degrees you have in your field of view the bigger will
    be the size of the images rendered by the goggles. It is
    recommended not to buy goggles with a FOV of fewer than 25 degrees.
    2. **Resolution:** It refers to the image quality and the experience
    shows that it is best to keep the video resolution between
    the standard parameters set by the goggles manufacturer.
